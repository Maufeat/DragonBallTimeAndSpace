(Version numbers: http://semver.org/)


1.0.2:
Fixes:
  - OS X: Asset Store packages still weren't getting the right child process
    permissions, so now the executable permission is always added when
    starting a browser in the Editor.


1.0.1:
Fixes:
  - Rebuild package so ZFGameBrowser has the correct initial permissions
    on OS X.
  - Correctly build browser_assets runtime resource even if there is no
    BrowserAssets directory.
  - NewWindow demo explains how to unzip BrowserAssets like MainDemo.
  - Demo explanation should no longer be replaced by an error on very
    slow computers.
  - Disabling and re-enabling a BrowserGUI GameObject should no longer
    break automatic resizing.


1.0.0:
  Initial release
