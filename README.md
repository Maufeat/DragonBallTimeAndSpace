## Requirements and Setup

This is (currently) only working with Unity 5.3, so steps are:


1. Download and setup Unity 5.3.8p2: [**Click Here**](https://download.unity3d.com/download_unity/702ec25c6a03/Windows64EditorInstaller/UnitySetup64-5.3.8p2.exe)
2. Download and install the original Game Client (for StreamingAssets): [**Click Here**](https://mega.nz/file/GrgRjSQK#hk53zLlggWweSF-8f64PmU0SPb9XmG_WwNzPG5S8KvQ)
3. Copy the StreamingAssets Folder from the Client to the Unity Project in `/Assets/StreamingAssets/`
4. (Optional) There currently only exists one server with tools from atidot3, you can donwload the project here: https://github.com/atidot3/DragonTimeSpace/

**There is currently a server in development by me in Rust, it will be published when somewhat presentable**
